# NICV

Side-Channel Attacks (SCA) are considered a serious threat against embedded cryptography. Therefore security-critical chips must be tested for SCA resistance before deployment or certification. SCA are powerful but can need a lot of
computation power, especially in the presence of countermeasures. The computation
complexity of these attacks can be reduced by selecting a small subset of points
where leakage prevails. In this paper, we propose a method to detect relevant leakage
points in side-channel traces. The method is based on Normalized Inter-Class Variance
(NICV). A key advantage of NICV over state-of-the-art is that NICV does neither
need a clone device nor the knowledge of secret parameters of the crypto-system.
NICV has a low computation requirement and it detects leakage using public information like input plaintexts or output ciphertexts only. It can also be used to test the
efficiency of leakage models, the quality of traces and robustness of countermeasures.
A theoretical rationale of NICV with practical application on real crypto-systems are
provided to support our claims.
